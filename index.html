                    <p> Durban- Infrequent visitors to uLundi, in northern KwaZulu-Natal,
                        would be forgiven for thinking the old legislature building became a white elephant when the
                        provincial government relocated its sittings to Pietermaritzburg.
                        Little has been said about the relocation 18 years ago. However,those who are regulars to the
                        Zulu nation's
                        traditional capital would know the massive modern facility.
